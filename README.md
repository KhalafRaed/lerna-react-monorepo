# Create-React-App Monorepo with Lerna

Projects like Babel, React, Angular, Ember, Meteor, Jest, and many others develop all of their packages within a single repository (multi-package repositories or monorepos), this solution introduced to split up large codebases into separate independently versioned packages, which is useful for code sharing. we still can acheive the same gaol by using multiple repositories, but making changes across repositories is messy and difficult to track. 

Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.
